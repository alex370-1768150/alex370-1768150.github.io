        <h1>Alex's Favorite Sport</h1>
        <p style="color:darkblue "> My favorite sport is by far skateboarding, I don't do it as often, but as a child I loved it.
        I hope one day I have to the opportunity to teach my children how to do it and also take them to competitions as well,
        but in order to do that, I might have to start practicing again.</p>

        <p style="color:darkgreen"> My favorite skateboarders include: Paul Rodriguez, Nyjah Huston, Ryan Scheckler and Sean Malto.
        Many people always question me why Tony Hawk is not my list, but my favorite skaters are all "street leage", meaning they focus
        more on tricks than getting high in the air</p>
